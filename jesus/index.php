		<p>
			Born in the small town of Bethlehem roughly 2000 years ago,
			Jesus Christ changed everything. Jesus proclaimed that He
			was the Son of God in human form. He performed many miracles
			and taught many lessons to prove His godly authority with
			words and actions. As an act of love, He was crucified under
			the Roman Empire although He was undeserving of death. Jesus
			sacrificed Himself for sinful mankind, to save them from
			sin's inevitable consequence, death. To further prove this,
			he rose again three days after His death and appeared to
			hundreds. Jesus is not just a man, nor just a teacher. He is
			the saviour of the world.
		<p>
			The sin of mankind has caused separation between God and
			man, with the consequences of human sin leading to death.
			Jesus came to reconnect us with God, by paying the penance
			of sin in our place. He died a gruesome death even though He
			had led a perfect life, to reconcile us to God. Jesus
			proclaimed that belief and acceptance of Him is the only way
			for sinners to be saved from their pending condemnation. He
			calls for us to repent and to live the true life that was
			designed for us, following in God's ways.
