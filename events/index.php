            PBT is our weekly bible talk, it is wonderful way to hear and learn from God’s word as well as meeting other students in CU. Each week we are led through a bible passage by one of our Senior Staff, afterwards we hang out and have a chat over some food.

        </h1>
        <p class = "event-details__content">
            Smaller groups than PBT, bible studies foster friendships and encourage active discussion of weekly bible passages. Every Bible study is led by students or staff who are trained by the senior staff to guide their group. Each week we look at a bible passage learning about the context of the passage, the principles underlying the passage and how we might apply this passage to our own lives. Bible studies are formed within faculty groups. They meet weekly at various times throughout the week so there is plenty of flexibility to choosing which study time suits your personal schedule.

            SPT’s are intimate prayer groups of three to five people that aim to support one another and the wider community through prayer and fellowship. SPT’s provide a opportunity for students to actively pray for each other and for other students at Melbourne University. SPT’s also function to equip and build up students to be able to share the gospel with their peers. The focus of SPT’s is to pray for the sharing of the gospel with non believers.

            Christian Union runs several camps throughout the year. Each camp explores the Christian Faith all with differing focuses depending upon the camp. We start each year with Gear up. This camp prepares our current students, particularly our leaders, practically and spiritually for the year ahead. Base Camp is next, which is a our faculty specific camps. They are an opportunity for new and current students to bond as a faculty whilst growing their faith. During the winter break we have our CU wide camp, Summit, which brings all of Melbourne University Christian Union together for a week of praising God, hearing from his word and spending quality time together. At the end of the year we have our National Training Event (NTE). This is a nation wide conference held in Canberra and brings together Christians Unions from all over Australia. It is designed to help grow students in their knowledge of and ability to share the gospel. NTE prepares Christians from across the country to take on the future with confidence and power from God's word.

        <p class = "event-details__content">
            At Cross Cultures we meet at 6pm on Thursdays to have dinner, make friends and read the bible together. No matter whether you have had lots of experience reading the bible or none at all, everyone is welcome. It is a wonderful time of meeting other students who are living away from home in a foreign country and to create friendships with them. We meet at St Jude's Anglican Church, 2 Keppel Street, Carlton (just a short walk from Melbourne Uni).
