                          Ailyn Irvita Ravinther is a 2nd year Biomedicine student from Malaysia. She spent the last 5 years of her life in a beautiful lake town, Kampar. Living away from the craziness of the city, brought her heart closer to God and she had the blessing of serving as a leader in the Christian Fellowship of her school.  At present, she’s still figuring out what to do with her future but she’s certain that serving God is in the picture. Outside university work, she enjoys reading, (binge) watching tv shows, watching instructional cooking videos (not necessarily actually cooking) and sleeping in. Ailyn is excited to grow and serve as the Secretary—she’s glad to be a part of making things happen in CU.

                          Hi I’m the Missions Representative on the Exec (general committee member). I’m excited about this role because I get super excited about Jesus name being proclaimed ALL over the world. I’m a second year arts student majoring in psychology and minoring in Islamic Studies. I love learning about people, and how Jesus can fulfil the needs of every individual no matter their cultural background. Some things I enjoy are sunny days, op-shopping, and hanging out with friends. I’m always keen for interesting chats so feel free to stalk my facebook and message me about anything, especially if you have any questions or ideas about missions.
