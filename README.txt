Hey guys

This is a static website, there is a home page called index.php
and we use the idea of templates so there is a head.php that is uniform
accross all pages

The file handling that logic of head, body files is ti.php

It uses SASS for CSS (check sass folder), you use

npm run start

to monitor when a change occurs and saves a new version of the compiled
CSS in the css folder

To run the PHP, I installed xampp server or something like that
It is the Apache one

When you run that server, you can go to a browser and view the website
using the URL

localhost/cuwebsite
