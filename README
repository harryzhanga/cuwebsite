Hey guys

This is a static website, there is a home page called index.php
and we use the idea of templates so there is a head.php that is uniform
accross all pages

The ti.php handles the logic which allows a common php file to be at the common accross each webpage.

It uses SASS for CSS (check sass folder), you use

npm run start

to monitor when a change occurs and saves a new version of the compiled
CSS in the css folder

To run the PHP, I installed xampp server or something like that
It is the Apache one

When you run that server, you can go to a browser and view the website
using the URL

localhost/cuwebsite


Uploading:
git add *
git commit -m "commit message"
git push origin master

You can log into my godaddy server through Putty using

IP: 148.66.136.120
Port: 22
username : harryzhang
The password is 1P....


Be careful when you update that the links to the home and other sites still work
